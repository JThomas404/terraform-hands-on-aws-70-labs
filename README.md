## Overview

This repository is the hub of over 70 hands-on Terraform labs completed as part of journey in doing the **"Master the Terraform Associate with 70+ AWS-Based Labs"** course. These labs follow the **Terraform Associate 003 objectives** and use Amazon Web Services (AWS) as the primary cloud provider. Each project is in its own directory folder, with its own documentation (e.g. `README.md`) implemented to build real-world Terraform proficiency.

The goal of this project is to document applied infrastructure-as-code skills using Terraform, with a focus on clarity, reproducibility, and security best practices.

## Real-World Business Value

This project simulates how a cloud engineer would provision, secure, and manage cloud infrastructure using Terraform in a production setting. By following the Terraform Associate objectives through AWS-centric labs, this project demonstrates how automation, modularity, and state management reduce manual effort, configuration drift, and human error.

## Project Folder Structure

```
terraform-hands-on-aws-70-labs/
└── README.md
# This will be updated once the course is completed.
```

Each folder represents a category of labs aligned with specific Terraform topics or workflows.

## Conclusion

This repository showcases a complete hands-on journey through Terraform’s capabilities using AWS. It documents not just implementation, but also decision-making, validation, and architecture thinking suitable for real-world cloud environments. This experience reflects readiness to manage infrastructure at scale using industry-standard tools and workflows.

See [Course Reference](https://github.com/Thomas404/terraform-hands-on-aws-70-labs/blob/main/course-reference.md) for the complete outline of Terraform objectives and lab mappings from the official course, including the references (Objective / Hands-On Labs / Documentation / Quizzes) I utilised while building these labs to conceptualise Terraform.

A huge thank you to Bryan and Gabe, two official HashiCorp Ambassadors, for delivering an incredibly insightful course and training that prepared me and improved my skills as a cloud engineer. I can ardently attribute much of my Terraform knowledge to these gentlemen. I highly recommend taking their course if you wish to improve your Terraform IaC skills and take them to the next level: [Course Link](https://www.udemy.com/course/terraform-hands-on-labs)
